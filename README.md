# controller-ev3
This is a script to use EV3 robots and raspberrys on remo.tv!
## **Getting started:**
You need to install Remo.TV controller on a raspberry (I used Pi 4 4GB)
https://github.com/remotv/controller
Then,
```
cd ~/remotv/hardware
```
Paste there only .py files.
Then edit ~remotv/controller.conf with your favorite editor.(nano in my case)
```
nano ~remotv/controller.conf
```
